# Structure Remover

A small (server-side) mod adding one command and one method to remove a set structure from your world.

:warning: This mod doesn't prevent the structures from being generated, but rather unregisters a set structure from your world.

You're a server administrator, tired to have some mobs spawn at a specific place because of a structure is registered there? You're a mod creator wanting to have your structure be unregistered right after its generation? You're a modpack creator who wishes to unregister some structures as well?<br>
Then look no further, for this mod is made for you!
